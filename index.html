      <p><em>"interesting new people"</em> is a band created by genius inventors <a href="#charlotte">charlotte berry game</a> and <a href="#scout">scout serket</a> and innovated by <a href="#holly">holly holiday</a> and <a href="#claire">claire television</a>. together they create a brand new genre of music called introspective phonk but it also doesn't have a name. don't ask for more information on the genre, lest you invoke the rage of the phonk killer.
      </p>
      <p>in april of 2025, in one evening, <a href="#charlotte">charlotte</a> and <a href="#scout">scout</a> created interesting new people's debut album, <em>phonk tuah</em>. later in the same month, with <a href="#holly">holly</a>, they created <em>scary phonk</em>. now with <a href="#claire">claire</a>, the band is currently working on several brand new albums but are very very busy with their various jobs as multi-million dollar ceo's, mafia bosses and unemployed chuds.
      </p>
